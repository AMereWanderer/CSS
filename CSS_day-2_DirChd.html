      You might think that news of “major AI breakthroughs” would do nothing but
      help machine learning’s (ML) adoption. If only. Even before the latest
      splashes other generative AI tools — the rich narrative about an emerging,
      all-powerful AI was already a growing problem for applied ML.

        That’s because for most ML projects, the buzzword “AI” goes too far. It
        overly inflates expectations and distracts from the precise way ML will
        improve business operations.

        <b>Here’s the problem:</b> Most people conceive of ML as “AI.” This is a
        reasonable misunderstanding. But “AI” suffers from an unrelenting,
        incurable case of vagueness — it is a catch-all term of art that does
        not consistently refer to any particular method or value proposition.
        Calling ML tools “AI” oversells what most ML business deployments
        actually do
